          <h3>Tyler</h3>
          <p>
            Meet Tyler - the resident bike mechanic and problem solver
            extraordinaire. With his trusty wrench and can-do attitude, Tyler
            can fix just about any bike-related issue that comes his way.
            Despite his gruff exterior, he's always willing to go the extra mile
            to make sure our customers leave happy and satisfied.

          <h3>Will</h3>
          <p>
            Say hello to Will - our customer service superstar. Whether he's
            answering phone calls, responding to emails, or helping customers in
            person, Will always has a smile on his face and a kind word to
            share. He's the heart and soul of our team, and we don't know what
            we'd do without him.

          <h3>Ron</h3>
          <p>
            Last but not least, there's Ron - the resident coffee spill expert
            and perpetual latecomer. But don't let his quirks fool you - Ron is
            an invaluable member of our team. He may not be the most punctual,
            but he's always willing to lend a helping hand and has a talent for
            making people laugh. We wouldn't trade him for anyone else.
